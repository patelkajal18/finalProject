        <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"><b>College Experience</b> <br>"UC Berkeley was a very nice experience and a bit bitter too. I went in as a Political Science major and somehow handle to graduate with a BA in political science. My first semester was very difficult and although a lot of the people who started with me under the same major moved to different majors, I decided to stick with political science. It was a difficult major for me because there's a lot of writing and heavy reading and I feel I was lacking basic skills due to my upbringing. I did my elementary, middle school and part of my high school back in El Salvador. When I came here, I didn't know a word in English. It was in high school where I had to learn not only to speak it, but to read it and understand it. Three years after my first year in high school I graduated and went to Chabot Community College. Chabot definitely provided me with new tools and helped me refine my English. I feel my English improved at Chabot and with it my ability to write and read. However, most of my classmates grew up reading in English, writing in English and so things were not as difficult for them as they were for me. I tried my best despite my language barrier and despite my disconnection to the culture and the politics in this country.  

My situation got more difficult due to personal problems back home. It became difficult to focus in school. I commuted every day to school and the commuting became tiring and stressful. My second year at Berkeley I was diagnosed with anxiety. I got a severe case of anxiety that was characterized by constant panic attacks. I started missing classes because I was so sick there were times I was afraid to ride BART; I was afraid to leave home. Other times, I got myself to go to school, but had to leave in a middle of a class because I had a sudden panic attack. It made me so sad to see I was not the same anymore. I felt useless. Yet, I knew what I wanted and neither my problems at home nor my panic attacks stopped me from achieving my goals. I know that a lot of my problems came as part of my life as an immigrant, but Iâ€™m proud to be one because it is thanks to my story as an immigrant that I am the person I am today.  

The day of my graduation was a day of victory for I had survived the adversities that came along the way. I was proud of what I had done; it was not easy. I felt as if I had been dragging my feet to the finish line, but with the help of many good people I moved forward a step at a time. I had accomplished something no one in my family had accomplished before, and with that not only I had overcame my obstacles, but I had set an example for my siblings and the youth in my community. 

In spite of all the difficulties I have faced along the way, I am proud of my journey, which I could only have walked as an immigrant woman."

<p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"> <b>First Generation Student</b> <br>"Growing up being the first person in my family to be born in America I didn't necessarily know I was different until I started school. My skin, hair, eyes, the way I spoke, the language I spoke, and even the food I ate was foreign and a source of ridicule for the 'diverse' community around me. It was a fight growing confidence in myself, in school, in my beauty, and in my dreams. Today I am going to the university of my dreams, happy as can be with all of my life; different tongue, hair, skin, food and all. If I have any advice (not that I'm qualified to give it) to the same little girl I was almost 20 years ago it would be to not let your originality be a source of insecurity. Wear your colors, your race, your face proudly." <br>-Anonymous </p>

	<p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"> <b>My Experience as an Immigrant </b> <br>"Estefania was born in Tepatitlan, Jalisco and came to the United States at the age of six. This transition brought her to the Central Valley, where she has lived ever since. Her grandparents, aunts, and uncles were instrumental in fostering a space for her mother and sisters to thrive as they navigated the United States without legal status. Through their guidance and support she transferred from Modesto Junior College to the University of California Davis, where she recently graduated.

In Modesto she worked as a community organizer for the non-profit (CBC) Congregations Building Community, an affiliate of People Organizing Community through Organizing. Through this work, she met with Governor Jerry Brown to advocate for the signing of AB 60. She later spoke alongside the Governor during the signing of the bill in 2013.

In Davis she worked at the AB 540 and Undocumented Student Center and used the time at Davis to attend various trainings and forums to sharpen her skills as an organizer, professional, and advocate for immigrant communities. She hopes to continue to do transformative work to more accurately represent the great power immigrant communities have in the United States and across the world."</p>
