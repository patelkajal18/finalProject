      <p class="w3-large">Here at consonance our goal is to build a community for people to get help and express their emotions as well as opinions. In our group we have all faced challenges within our culture and community as well. We aspire to create a network that will allow people of any race feel safe and secure, as they read about their rights as beings within the united states. </p>
